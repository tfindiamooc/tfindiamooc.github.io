	<h1>Practical Machine Learning with TensorFlow 2.0</h1>
	<p>
	Welcome to <a href='https://swayam.gov.in/nd1_noc19_cs81/'>Practical Machine Learning with TensorFlow 2.0</a> MOOC. 
	As the name suggests we will mainly focus on practical aspects of ML that involves writing code in Python with 
	TensorFlow 2.0 API.  In every session, we will review the concept from theory point of view and then jump straight 
	into implementation.  We will be using <a href='http://colab.research.google.com'>Google Colab</a> as a platform 
	for coding these models.  We will mainly cover material from the following page: 
	<a href='https://www.tensorflow.org/beta'>https://www.tensorflow.org/beta</a></p>. 

	<p>I would strongly advise students to run the code and experience how the code works.  Once you get the basic idea
	of the concept and its implementation, you can spend some time looking at the details of each function from 
	<a href='https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.0/api_docs/python/tf'>TF RC 2.0 API</a>.</p>

	<p>We will learn how to use tf.Keras and tf.Estimator APIs for building models.  We will also learn to use 
	tf.Dataset API for building input pipelines for bringing data to ML models.  Later in the course, we will 
	learn how to build customized ML models and train them in distributed fashion.</p>

	<p>Wish you a great journey of learning TensorFlow with us!</p>
